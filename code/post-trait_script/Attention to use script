Attention to use script

before run any script, u have to check
-name of file hdf5
-postion x_wall 
-position ground
-time
-flow_height


Order: study flow without wall and then with wall

(1)without wall:
-flow_height, profil_density
-profil_vitesse
-flow_rate, time_constant_flow_rate

(2)with wall:
-dead_zone with profil_vitesse calculate at (1)
-force on wall, obstacle
